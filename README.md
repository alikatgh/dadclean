# dadclean

The idea of dadclean (Drag-and-Drop Cleaning) is to make a UI based program (that will run on Windows/Linux/Mac) to reduce the data cleaning part of the job based on common pattrens that can be found in specific .csv files that should be cleaded. 

For example, you have a .xslx file that have a ton of sub .xslx files into it and you should be able to extract those .xslx files separately, and if necessary, to visiaulise them, in this case, you can use **dadclean**, which will offer the features to work with your data and clean them in seconds according to your wishes.
